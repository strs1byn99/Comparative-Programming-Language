(a) To compute the distance between airports, use the haversine formula. The database contains degrees and minutes, which must be converted to radians. The result must be converted to miles.

(b) Planes fly at a constant speed of 500 miles per hour and always using great circle paths, so the arrival time can be computed from the departure time.

(c) A flight transfer always takes 30 minutes, so during a transfer at a hub, the departure of a connecting flight must be at least 30 minutes later than the arrival of the incoming flight.

(d) There are no overnight trips. The complete trip departs and arrives in the same day, although the final arrival time may be shown as greater than 23:59.
